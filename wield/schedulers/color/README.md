# Color Scheduling Policy 

This scheduling policy implements the Color scheduling algorithm, described in ??. It requires a dispatcher to enqueue the stage name any time an event is dispatched to a stage. 

We provide the scheduling policy and dispatcher in Color.hpp and ColorDispatcher.hpp respectively.
