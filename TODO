- allow injection of logging implementation into wield classes.

- functionality for setting processor affinity
- functionality for setting process and thread priority
- functionality to set NUMA affinity (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363804(v=vs.85).aspx)
- (not sure about this) change QueueBase template arguments to take queue_type as a template template parameter

Performance:
- In SchedulerBase, compare whether using done_.load(std::memory_order_acquire)/done_.store(true, std::memory_order_release) is better or whether just doing done_ = true; and reading done_ is better.
- Test different compiler options
- Benchmark the differences between just using std::clog with ofstream backend and asynchronous I/O.
- see if using std::array has a penalty versus C-style arrays
